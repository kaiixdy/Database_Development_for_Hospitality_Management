Watering Hole Dude Ranch Database Project

The Watering Hole Dude Ranch, located outside San Antonio, Texas, requires a well-structured database to efficiently manage its business operations. The ranch offers various cabins and vacation packages, where each package includes multiple activities. The system tracks information about cabins (capacity, size, and type), vacation packages (duration, rate per person), and activities (capacity and food requirements). Guests make reservations for specific packages and cabins, with each reservation capturing guest details and accommodation preferences. The goal of the project is to design and develop a database that improves business efficiency by automating the reservation process, managing customer information, and facilitating better organization of ranch activities and cabin usage.
