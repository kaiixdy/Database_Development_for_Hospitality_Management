Database Development for Hospitality Management
Watering Hole Dude Ranch SQL Project | May 2023

Designed and developed a relational database using Microsoft SQL Server to support daily operations at a hospitality business. The database manages cabins, guest reservations, vacation packages, and activities, enabling efficient resource allocation and business decision-making.

ðŸ”§ Key SQL Features Implemented:
8+ SQL queries for complex data analysis and operational reporting

JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and nested subqueries to extract business insights

Created a view (vw_PackageRevenue) to calculate revenue per package

Built a stored procedure (sp_CabinInventory) to dynamically retrieve available cabins by type

Used aggregations, date functions, and conditional filtering for performance metrics

ðŸ§  Example Business Use Cases:
Track guest arrivals during peak summer months to optimize staffing

List available cabins and identify those with above-average capacity for group bookings

Identify premium packages (4+ activities) for targeted marketing

Flag high-value reservations for loyalty program opportunities

Automate check-in/check-out tracking based on package duration
